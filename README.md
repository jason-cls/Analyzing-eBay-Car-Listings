# Analyzing eBay Car Listings
The focus of this project was to clean and analyze car listing data from eBay Kleinanzeigen. The dataset which was used was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle. A total of 50,000 data points were sampled from the dataset. The goal was to determine the average prices of popular car brands, and see if there is any correlation to average mileage by brand.

### Results
- Among the 15 most popular car brands German luxury cars were priced the highest
- The mean price of the luxury cars decreased as mean mileage increased
- No correlation was observed between price and mileage for non-luxury commercial cars

### Libraries used
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
